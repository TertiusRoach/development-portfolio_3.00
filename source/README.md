# Gulp Tasks

I use [Gulp Tasks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nickdodd79.gulptasks) with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to automate development tasks. Despite my efforts, Iâ€™ve given up on making this add-on fully compatible with every Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The ongoing challenges and compatibility issues have proven to be more trouble than theyâ€™re worth, leading me to seek other solutions.

### Final Output

Working with Gulp tasks can feel like being in an abusive relationship. Initially, Gulp appears to be an effective way to automate tasks and manage your project. Youâ€™re learning JavaScript with tangible results, and everything seems fine. However, as time goes on, the darker sides start to show. The relationship reveals its flaws, much like how an abusive partner might isolate you. Gulp traps you in a web of dependencies. You start with a few packages, but soon find yourself needing more. What initially seems manageable quickly becomes unmanageable. This is the dependency trap. Although Gulp is useful for learning JavaScript with concrete outputs, the increasing complexity can be discouraging. I've stored my old code here, thinking I might resurrect this old tech one day, but I doubt it. If you encounter any issues, Iâ€™ve switched over to [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

Your output should display the following:
